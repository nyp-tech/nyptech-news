Our student founders were treated to insightful sharing and flash-mentoring from our distinguished guests:

- Sun Yuanxin (Founder, StoryChopsticks)
- Benson Ong (Senior Lecturer, School of Business Management)
- Patrik Johansson (NYP Centre for Industry & Lifelong Learning)
- Dale Mcallister (Director IT, Connexi)
